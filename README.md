Image Quality Assessment Tool
Overview
This tool is a PyQt-based application designed for image quality assessment.
It provides various image processing functionalities such as histogram equalization, Sobel filtering, video cropping, frame extraction, and sharpness assessment of a selected region of interest (ROI). 

The tool is useful for analyzing and enhancing images, particularly in applications requiring image preprocessing, feature extraction, and quality assessment.

Features:
1️⃣ Display Image
• Allows users to open and view an image.
• Provides basic UI controls for selecting an image file.

2️⃣ Histogram Equalization
• Enhances the contrast of an image by equalizing its intensity distribution.
• Useful for improving visibility in images with poor contrast.

3️⃣ Sobel Filter
• Applies the Sobel edge detection filter to highlight edges in an image.
• Helps in detecting significant changes in pixel intensity.

4️⃣ Video Cropping
• Allows users to select a portion of a video and crop it.
• Outputs a new video containing only the selected region.

5️⃣ Frame Extraction
• Extracts individual frames from a video file.
• Useful for selecting key frames for further processing or analysis.

6️⃣ Sharpness Assessment (ROI-Based)
• This tool allows users to select a Region of Interest (ROI) within an image and measure its sharpness. 
  Sharpness is a key factor in determining the clarity of an image and its ability to convey fine details.
